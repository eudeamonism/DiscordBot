## Deploy w/ Vercel
Didn't even have to install Express.js or even set up a server if you want to create a simple bot for Discord.

### GitHub Repository
Upload this code to your repository, and setup Vercel by linking your github account to it. Then you are able to create a new project and link to your repository with this code.

### Don't Forget Environment Variables
Before deploying, select Environment Variables and do something like this: TOKEN for the key and VALUE would be your token from Discord.dev.

### You need to create an Application instance
In Discord.dev. You need that token, and also you would have needed to sync your bot to your server, see their documentation.
